## Hi there👋, nice to see you here 😊

I started web dev when nobody thought about becoming a developer 👴, when we still were using floats and clearfixes, and IE6 non-existing support for PNGs was a no-go for some projects.

In today's world, I have rich experience with JavaScript, TypesScript, Vue, React, and NextJS but also with backend languages like PHP, NodeJs, and Jest, WordPress is a no stranger for me, usually creating templates with ACF and Gutenberg. 

If you want to see my skills in action, go ahead and visit <a href="https://boostit.services" target="_blank">https://boostit.services</a> - this is my website, something like a portfolio, something like a services page.

If you want to read more about what people say when working with me, feel free to visit <a href="https://boostit.services/reviews" target="_blank">https://boostit.services/reviews</a>

This Github will let you see online versions and go through code of my portfolio projects:
